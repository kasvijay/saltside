Assignment from saltside

The assignment is done fully using Swift code. There is no Storybord(s) or XIB(s) used so as to show my language skills.

There are two view controllers for
   1. Listing 
   2. Details

The listing page fetches data from the given API and populates the list. Edge cases considered are
   1. Check for network connection
   2. Parsing error
  A loader will be shown until the data is loaded to the list view.
